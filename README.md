# TokenBid

TokenBid is a website for creating and bidding on auctions using tokens purchasable through a PayPal portal. Before participating, users are required to create an account and verify their email. Users will then have access to a gallery of ongoing auctions they may view and place a bid on. They may also add their own item with an image and description and start an auction for a specified length of time.
